You're allowed to use `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `sqrt()` (square root), `factorial()` (factorial), and `%` (modulus). You're also allowed to use `.4` (that's one 4) or `44` (that's two 4's) if you'd like. Just remember, you must use exactly four 4 digits total!\n",

For instance, $\\ 5\\ \\text{mod}\\ 2 = 1$, $\\ 13\\ \\text{mod}\\ 7 = 6$, and $\\ 14\\ \\text{mod}\\ 7 = 0$.\n",
