In the egg white the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 63 C, while in the  yolk the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 70 C. For a soft boiled egg, the white needs to have been heated long enough to coagulate at a temperature above 63 C, but the yolk should not be heated above 70 C. For a hard boiled egg, the center of the yolk should be allowed to reach 70 C.\n",

The first column is the number of decays $N$, the second is the time $t$ in seconds. We'd like to know the half-life $t_{1/2}$ of $^{137}\\text{Ba}$. It should follow the decay equation $$ N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t} $$ where $\\lambda = \\frac{\\log 2}{t_{1/2}}$. Using the techniques you've learned from the lecture and workshop, load the data from the file Ba137.txt into appropriately-named variables. Experiment with different values of $N$ and $\\lambda$ and plot the resulting equation on top of the data. (Python uses `exp()` to calculate the exponential function: i.e. `y = A*exp(-L*time)` ) Don't worry about automating this process yet (unless you *really* want to!) just try adjusting things by hand until the equation matches the data pretty well. What is your best estimate for $t_{1/2}$?"
