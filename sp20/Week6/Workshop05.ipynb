    "We will discuss simulations in greater detail later in the semester. The first step in simulating nature -- which, despite Einstein's objections, is playing dice after all -- is to learn how to generate some numbers that appear random. Of course, computers cannot generate true random numbers -- they have to follow an algorithm. But the algorithm may be based on something that is difficult to predict (e.g. the time of day you are executing this code) and therefore *look* random to a human. Sequences of such numbers are called *pseudo-random*. \n",
