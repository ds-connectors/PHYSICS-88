    "Please complete workshop activities in code cells in this iPython notebook. The activities titled **Practice** are purely for you to explore Python, and no particular output is expected. Some of them have some code written, and you should try to modify it in different ways to understand how it works. Although no particular output is expected at submission time, it is _highly_ recommended that you read and work through the practice activities before or alongside the exercises. However, the activities titled **Exercise** have specific tasks and specific outputs expected. Include comments in your code when necessary. Enter your name in the cell at the top of the notebook. \n",

    "Physical systems that evolve in time can be easily (but not always quickly) simulated on a computer.   All you need to know is the function that takes the system from its current state to a future state:\n",

    "In the above equation, $S_1$ and $S_2$ represent the current and future states, respectively.  $S_2$ is the state of the system after a short amount of time, $dt$.  The function $f$, which encodes the dynamics of the system, often depends on the current state and the choice of $dt$.  Choosing a smaller time step, $dt$, generally improves the accuracy of any simulation."
