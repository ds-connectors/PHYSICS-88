    "[Adapted from Ayars, Problem 0-5] Create a single figure that shows separate graphs of vertical position, velocity, and acceleration for an object in free-fall, as in the sample plot below. Your plot should have a single horizontal time axis and separate stacked graphs showing position, velocity, and acceleration each on their own vertical axis. The online [matplotlib gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) will probably be helpful! Make each curve a different color. (The example below uses magenta, cyan, and yellow.)\n",

You can use any of them by inserting a `set_cmap` command after your `imshow`, `scatter`, or any plotting function that can use a colormap. For instance, `plt.set_cmap('jet')`. some colormaps, such as `jet`, `hot`, `gray`, and `viridis` (among others), have special commands to use them: you can type `plt.gray()` instead of `plt.set_cmap('gray')`. See [this doc](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html?highlight=colormaps#matplotlib.pyplot.colormaps) or type `help(plt.colormaps)` for more detailed instructions on colormaps.\n",
