    "These exercises used to be part of Workshop 3 but have now been made optional. The pedagogical justification is that although list comprehensions are ubuquitous in Python, they do not appear in most other programming languages. Moreover, since they do not contain any additional flow control concepts beyond those taught by this point (`while`, `for`, `if`-`elif`-`else`), they do not teach any broad programming concepts. Therefore, for the student it would be helpful but not strictly necessary to work through these exercises."
