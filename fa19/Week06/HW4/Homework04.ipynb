    "The data sample for this problem comes from the <a href=\"http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/e158\">E158</a> experiment at SLAC (a national lab near that Junior university across the Bay). E158 measured a parity-violating asymmetry in Møller (electron-electron) scattering. This was a fixed-target experiment, which scattered longitudinally-polarized electrons off atomic (unpolarized) electrons in the 1.5m liquid hydrogen target. The data below contains a snapshot of 10,000 \"events\" from this experiment (overall, the experiment collected almost 400 million such events over the course of about 4 months). Each event actually records a pair of pulses: one for the right-handed electron (spin pointing along momentum) and one for the left-handed electron. For each event, we record 4 variables:\n",

Choose the number of bins wisely, i.e. so that the width of each bin is smaller than the width of the peak, and at the same time so that the number of entries in the most populated bin is relatively large. Since this plot represents randomly-collected data, plotting error bars would be appropriate.\n",

Compare these fractions with the quantiles of the Gaussian distribution (see lecture notes) ? \n"
