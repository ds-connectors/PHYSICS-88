    "Please complete workshop activities in code cells in this iPython notebook. The activities titled **Practice** are purely for you to explore Python. Some of them may have some code written, and you should try to modify it in different ways to understand how it works. Although no particular output is expected at submission time, it is _highly_ recommended that you read and work through the practice activities before or alongside the exercises. However, the activities titled **Exercise** have specific tasks and specific outputs expected. Include comments in your code when necessary. Enter your name in the cell at the top of the notebook. The workshop should be submitted on bCourses under the Assignments tab."

    "A problem that is frequently encountered is one of sampling one distribution but only having direct access to sampling another distribution (often the uniform distribution). As an example, we will try out one way to draw numbers from a Gaussian distribution starting with numbers drawn only from a uniform distribution. As it turns out, there are multiple ways of doing this. This particular method is known as the \"Box-Muller transform\".\n",

Therefore, if we can simulate throwing these darts and checking whether they landed inside the shaded region or outside the shaded region, we can estimate the area of the shaded region. In this case, the area of the shaded region is proportional to $\\pi$, so we can then use that area to estimate $\\pi$.\n",
