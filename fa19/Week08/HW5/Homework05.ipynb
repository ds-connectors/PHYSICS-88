    "You are given a dataset (peak.dat) from a gamma-ray experiment consisting of ~1000 hits. Each line in the file corresponds to one recorded gamma-ray event, and stores the the measured energy of the gamma-ray. We will assume that the energies are randomly distributed about a common mean, and that each event is uncorrelated to others. Read the dataset from the enclosed file and:\n",
    "1. Produce a histogram of the distribution of energies. Choose the number of bins wisely, i.e. so that the width of each bin is smaller than the width of the peak, and at the same time so that the number of entries in the most populated bin is relatively large. Since this plot represents randomly-collected data, plotting error bars would be appropriate.\n",
    "1. Fit the distribution to a Gaussian function using an unbinned fit (<i>Hint:</i> use <tt>scipi.stats.norm.fit()</tt> function, see for example Lecture05.ipynb), and compare the parameters of the fitted Gaussian with the mean and standard deviation computed in Homework04\n",
    "1. Fit the distribution to a Gaussian function using a binned least-squares fit (<i>Hint:</i> use <tt>scipy.optimize.curve_fit()</tt> function, see Lecture05.ipynb for example), and compare the parameters of the fitted Gaussian and their uncertainties to the parameters obtained in the unbinned fit above. \n",
    "1. Re-make your histogram from (1) with twice as many bins, and repeat the binned least-squares fit from (3) on the new histogram. How sensitive are your results to binning ? \n",
    "1. How consistent is the distribution with a Gaussian? In other words, compare the histogram from (1) to the fitted curve, and compute a goodness-of-fit value, such as $\\chi^2$/d.f.\n"

Estimate the probability that the straight line you found is an adequate description of the observed data if it is distributed with the uncertainty guessed by your lab partner. (Hint: use scipy.stats.chi2 class to compute the quantile of the chi2 distribution).  What can you conclude from these results? \n",

    "1. Assume that the best-fit line found in Part 1 is a good fit to the data. Estimate the uncertainty in measurement of $y$ from the scatter of the observed data about this line. Again, assume that all the data points have equal weight. Use this to estimate the uncertainty in both the slope and the intercept of the best-fit line. This is the technique you will use in the Optical Pumping lab to determine the uncertainties in the fit parameters.\n",
