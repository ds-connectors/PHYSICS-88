    "A fixed point of a function $g$ is defined to be a point $x_0$ where $g(x_0) = x_0$. One method of finding a fixed point is to simply guess a value, and keep applying $g$ to it. If at some iteration we reach the fixed point, then every iteration after it will return the same value, and we know we have solved the equation. So we can try applying $g$ for many iterations and watch for convergence. Doing so solves the equation\n",

    "Indeed, the `bisect` method operates on the \"Intermediate Value Theorem\" which just makes the observation that if a continuous function $f(x)$ changes sign over an interval $x\\in [a,b]$, then there must exist at least one value of $x$ in that interval for which $f(x) = 0$. As a result, this method cannot find the root at $x=0$. So to use `scipy.optimize.bisect` you need to give it three arguments: the name of the python function which encodes $f(x)$, the left end of your interval ($a$) and the right end of your interval $b$. But further more, $a$ and $b$ must be such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite sign. Try changing some of these values in the call to `bisect` below!"
