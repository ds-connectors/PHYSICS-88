Some of them may have some code written, and you should try to modify it in different ways to understand how it works. Although no particular output is expected at submission time, it is _highly_ recommended that you read and work through the practice activities before or alongside the exercises. However, the activities titled **Exercise** have specific tasks and specific outputs expected. Include comments in your code when necessary. Enter your name in the cell at the top of the notebook. The workshop should be submitted on bCourses under the Assignments tab."
