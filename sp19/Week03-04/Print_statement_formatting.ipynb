    "* e.g., in `{0:3.2f}` the element index is 0 and the format specification is `3.2f`\n",
    "* `[format_spec]` = `[[width][.precision][type]]`\n",
    "    * in `3.2f`, the width is `3`, the precision is `2`, and the type is `f`\n",
    "    * role of the width: specifies the **minimum** character width used to print out the number\n",
    "        * easiest to understand what this means using an example or by just experimenting with it\n",
    "        * e.g., if trying to print the number `5.634` (which is five characters wide), and you specify a width of `2`, there will be no effect because the number itself is more than 2 characters long, but if you specify a width of `7`, then two space characters will be printed in front of the number in order to have seven characters\n",
    "        * if omitted, the field width will just be the same size as the data to fill it, e.g. 5 characters for `  5.364`  \n",

    "    * options for the type\n",

    "            * `d` \tDecimal Integer. Outputs the number in base 10.\n",
    "            * `o` \tOctal format. Outputs the number in base 8.\n",
    "            * `x` \tHex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using lower-case letters for the digits above 9.\n",
    "            * `X` \tHex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using upper-case letters for the digits above 9.\n",
    "            * `n` \tNumber. This is the same as 'd', except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the                          appropriate number separator characters.\n",
    "        * for a floating point number\n",
    "            * `e` \tExponent notation. Prints the number in scientific notation using the letter ‘e’ to indicate the exponent. The default precision is 6.\n",
