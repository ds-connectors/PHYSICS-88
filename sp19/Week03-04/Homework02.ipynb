    "\n",
    "1. Write a function `factorial(n)` that takes an integer $n$ and returns $n!$ as an integer. It should yield $1$ when $n=0$. You may assume that the argument will also be an integer greater than or equal to 0.\n",

    "1. Using the form of the binomial coefficient given above, write a function `binomial(n,k)` that calculates the binomial coefficient for given $n$ and $k$. Make sure your function returns the answer in the form of an integer (not a float) and gives the correct value of 1 for the case where $k=0$. (Hint: Use your `factorial` function from Part 1.)\n",
