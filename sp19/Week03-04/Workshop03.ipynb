    "## When to define your own functions\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have the power to write your own functions, but when should you? And when should you just write code to do something in the main body of your program, without having a function do it? [Chapter 2.7](http://www.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters/programming.pdf) of Newman's [*Python Programming for Physicists*](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/computational-physics/) has some great recommendations on good python programming style. You should go read them! But in particular, he has this to say about writing your own functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Employ user-defined functions, where appropriate.** Use user-defined functions to represent repeated operations, especially complicated operations. Functions can greatly increase the legibility of your program. Avoid overusing them, however: simple operations, ones that can be represented by just a line or two of code, are often better left in the main body of the program, because it allows you to follow the flow of the calculation when reading through your program without having to jump to a function and back. Normally you should put your function definitions at the start of your program (probably after imports and constant definitions). This ensures that each definition appears before the first use of the function it defines and that the definitions can be easily found and modified when necessary."

Your computer might be clever and eventually kill the process once it gets too big, or you might have to reboot. If this every happens to you, it will generally only be because your loop is trying to do intensive calculations or display lots of text or images---for instance if you accidentally write an infinite loop that keeps producing plots.
