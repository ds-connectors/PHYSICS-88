E158 measured a parity-violating asymmetry in MÃ¸ller (electron-electron) scattering. This was a fixed-target experiment, which scattered longitudinally-polarized electrons off atomic (unpolarized) electrons in the 1.5m liquid hydrogen target. The data below contains a snapshot of 10,000 \"events\" from this experiment (overall, the experiment collected almost 400 million such events over the course of about 4 months).

Since this plot represents randomly-collected data, plotting error bars would be appropriate.\n",
