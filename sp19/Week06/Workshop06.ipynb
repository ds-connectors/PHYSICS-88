    "**Practice 1:** Use the syntax you have just learned to create an ASCII file titled \"`sine.txt`\" with two columns containing 20 x and 20 y values. The x values should range from $0$ to $2\\pi$ - you can use `np.linspace()` to generate these values (as many as you want). The y values should be $y = sin(x)$ (you can use `np.sin()`) for this. Then, use a `for` loop as above to write a new line for each pair of x and y values. To make sure that each x,y pair is on a new line, remember to add `\\n` to the end of each line like above. To separate the values by a tab so that the columns are nicely aligned, you can use the \"character\" `\\t`.  So `\\n` inserts a new line and `\\t` inserts a tab. You may wish to use some kind of string formatting to decimals from running too far. Here is an example with just one data point:\n",

    "**Exercise 1:** This exercise is meant to put many of the skills you have practiced thus far together. In this exercise, we are going to use I/O methods to see if we can find some correlations in some fake housing data. You will need the following files which should be in your directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    house_locs_rent.txt\n",
    "    bus_stops.txt\n",
    "    grocery_stores.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `house_locs_rent.txt` is a list of the locations of 500 houses and ther respective rents, and it has 3 columns:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    x-coordinate y-coordinate rent (in USD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `bus_stops.txt` is a list of the locations of bus stops and it has 2 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    x-coordinate y-coordinate\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `grocery_stores.txt` is a list of the locaitons of grocery stores and it has 2 columns: \n",
    "\n",
    "    x-coordinate y-coordinate\n",
    "\n",
    "All 3 files have one-line headers that you will want to ignore when loading the data. The goal of the exercise is to determine how much of the variation in the rent is predicted by variation in the distance between a house and its closest bus stop or by the distance between a house and its closest grocery store.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine this, for each of the 500 houses, you will need to first calculate its distance to its nearest bus stop and its distance to its nearest grocery store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will use a measure called the Pearson correlation coefficient (which you will use in Homework04) to give an estimate of how much of the variation in the rent is predicted by variation in these distances. The Pearson correlation coefficient is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose I have $N$ data points each with two variables $X_i$ and $Y_i$, where $i = 1\\dots N$. Suppose I want to know how much of the variation in $Y$ is predicted by the variation in $X$. The correlation coefficient $R$ is a value between -1 and 1 with the following meaning: when $R=0$, $X$ and $Y$ are independent of each other. When $R>0$, we say they are positively correlated because if $X$ increases we can expect that $Y$ will increase as well. When $R<0$ we say they are negatively or oppositely correlated because if $X$ increases we can expect that $Y$ will decrease. $R$ is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[(X_i - \\mu_X)(Y_i - \\mu_Y)]}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} = \\frac{1}{N \\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} \\sum_{i=1}^N \n",
    "(X_i - \\mu_X)(Y_i - \\mu_Y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_X$ is the average of $X_i$ over the dataset, $\\mu_Y$ is the average of $Y_i$ over the dataset, $\\sigma_X$ is the standard deviation of $X_i$ over the dataset, and $\\sigma_Y$ is the standard deviation of $Y_i$ over the dataset. For calculating those quantities, you may find `np.mean()` and `np.std()` helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However**, you must write your *own* correlation coefficient function. It can use `np.mean()` and `np.std()` but it should not call `np.cov` or `np.corrcoef` . \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** Your code should contain a function to calculate correlation coefficients as well as any other functions that you want to write (for example, a distance function, a minimum distance function...). The output should be the correlation coefficients between the pairs of variables (minimum distances to bus stops, minimum distances to grocery stores, rents) appropriately labeled. Also, create a CSV file titled `distances_rents.csv` and write the values of the minimum distances to the bus_stop and grocery store for each house along with its rent. For example, if the closest bus stop to the first house is 0.5 away and the closest grocery store to the first house is 1.5 away and the rent of the first house is 1250, then the first line of the CSV should read:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.5,1.5,1250\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional:** See if you can guess how I generated this fake data. To help sharpen your guess, try transforming the variables before computing the correlation coefficients. If the magnitude of the correlation coefficients goes up, that can be an indicator that you have found the correct form of the function. "
