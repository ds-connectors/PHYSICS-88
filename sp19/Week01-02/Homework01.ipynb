    "[Adapted from Langtangen, Exercise 1.12. You may derive the formula in Physics 112 or Physics 89] As an egg cooks, the proteins first denature and then coagulate. When the temperature exceeds a critical point, reactions begin and proceed faster as the temperature increases. In the egg white the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 63 C, while in the  yolk the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 70 C. For a soft boiled egg, the white needs to have been heated long enough to coagulate at a temperature above 63 C, but the yolk should not be heated above 70 C. For a hard boiled egg, the center of the yolk should be allowed to reach 70 C.\n",

    "[Adapted from Ayars, Problem 0-3] The data in file Ba137.txt (available here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celegante/code_chapter_0-_github/master/Ba137.txt) is actual data from a radioactive decay experiment; the first column is the number of decays $N$, the second is the time $t$ in seconds. We'd like to know the half-life $t_{1/2}$ of $^{137}\\text{Ba}$. It should follow the decay equation $$ N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t} $$ where $\\lambda = \\frac{\\log 2}{t_{1/2}}$. Using the techniques you've learned from the lecture and workshop, load the data from the file Ba137.txt into appropriately-named variables. Experiment with different values of $N$ and $\\lambda$ and plot the resulting equation on top of the data. (Python uses `exp()` to calculate the exponential function: i.e. `y = A*exp(-L*time)` ) Don't worry about automating this process yet (unless you *really* want to!) just try adjusting things by hand until the equation matches the data pretty well. What is your best estimate for $t_{1/2}$?"
