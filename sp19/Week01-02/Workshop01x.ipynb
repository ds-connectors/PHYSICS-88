Check that the operating system and 32/64 bit options at the top are correct before hitting download. The default options are probably good. If you're not sure whether your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit (most modern computers are 64-bit), here are directions to find out for [Windows](https://esupport.trendmicro.com/en-us/home/pages/technical-support/1038680.aspx), [Mac](http://www.chiefarchitect.com/support/article/KB-01230/determining-if-your-computer-is-32-bit-or-64-bit.html), and [Linux](http://www.howtogeek.com/198615/how-to-check-if-your-linux-system-is-32-bit-or-64-bit/).\n",
